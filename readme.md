A very simple demo project just to get my hands dirty with Terraform.
In this project, I design and deploy a apache webserver using terraform. 

I followed this simple [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLB_c_ayRMo). Overall, It's not the most in depth tutorial about terraform but great for absolute beginners.
